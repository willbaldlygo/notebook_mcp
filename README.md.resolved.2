# NoteBook MCP

An **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** server that enables AI agents (like Claude Desktop) to query your personal **Google NotebookLM** notebooks.

It uses a persistent, local browser session (via Playwright) to bypass the lack of an official API, allowing for "warm start" instant queries.

## ✨ Features
*   **Zero-API Access**: Works with any Google account; no enterprise API required.
*   **Warm Start**: Keeps a browser instance open in the background, making creating queries instant (after the first load).
*   **Persistent Auth**: Uses standard browser cookies to maintain your session.
*   **MCP Compliant**: Works out-of-the-box with any MCP client.

## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Installation
Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/notebook-mcp.git
cd notebook-mcp
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Authentication (Manual Cookie Export)
Since Google's security prevents automated headless logins, you must export your cookies:

1.  Log in to [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) in your regular Chrome browser.
2.  Open **DevTools** (Right-click -> Inspect) -> **Application** -> **Cookies**.
3.  Select `https://notebooklm.google.com`.
4.  Select all cookies (Cmd/Ctrl+A) and Copy (Cmd/Ctrl+C).
5.  Paste them into [notebooklm_cookies.json](file:///Users/will/.gemini/antigravity/brain/6ac700d1-78b2-4ef1-81e7-d60101a71d0f/notebooklm_cookies.json) in this directory.

> **Note**: Your [notebooklm_cookies.json](file:///Users/will/.gemini/antigravity/brain/6ac700d1-78b2-4ef1-81e7-d60101a71d0f/notebooklm_cookies.json) is git-ignored by default. Never commit it!

## 💻 Usage

### As an MCP Server (Claude Desktop)
Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notebooklm": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/notebook-mcp/.venv/bin/python3",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/notebook-mcp/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

### As a Library
You can use the session manager in your own Python scripts:

```python
from notebook_session import NotebookLMSession

session = NotebookLMSession(headless=True)
answer = session.query("https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/...", "Summarize this doc")
print(answer)
```

## ⚠️ Limitations
*   **Session Expiry**: Google cookies expire every few weeks. If the tool stops working, re-export your cookies.
*   **Single Threaded**: The browser automation is not designed for high-concurrency requests.
