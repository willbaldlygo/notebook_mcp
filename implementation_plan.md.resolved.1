# NotebookLM Client Implementation Plan

## Goal
Enable "Antigravity" to query the user's Google NotebookLM notebooks by replicating the browser automation and cookie injection strategy from the `notebooklm-skill` repository.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> **One-Time Interactive Login**: To avoid manual cookie pasting, I will create a setup script that launches a **visible** Chrome window on your machine. You will simply log in to Google NotebookLM in that window. Once logged in, the script will automatically capture and save the necessary authentication tokens for future use.

## Proposed Changes

### [NEW] `auth_setup.py`
Create a Python script to handle the one-time authentication:
1.  Launch a **visible** (non-headless) Playwright browser.
2.  Navigate to `https://notebooklm.google.com/`.
3.  Wait for the user to log in interactively.
4.  Once the URL indicates a successful login (or user presses Enter in terminal), capture the storage state (cookies + local storage).
5.  Save to `notebooklm_auth.json`.

### [NEW] `notebooklm_client.py`
Create a Python script that uses the saved `notebooklm_auth.json` to:
1.  Launch a **headless** browser context.
2.  Load state from `notebooklm_auth.json`.
3.  Navigate to the Notebook URL.
4.  Interact with the query interface.


## Verification Plan

### User Verification
1.  **Run Setup**: Run `python3 auth_setup.py`.
2.  **Action**: A Chrome window opens. Log in to your Google account.
3.  **Result**: Script saves `notebooklm_auth.json`.
4.  **Run Query**: Run `python3 notebooklm_client.py --url "..." --question "..."`.
5.  **Success**: Script returns answer without asking for login.
