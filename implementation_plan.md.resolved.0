# NotebookLM Client Implementation Plan

## Goal
Enable "Antigravity" to query the user's Google NotebookLM notebooks by replicating the browser automation and cookie injection strategy from the `notebooklm-skill` repository.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Authentication Requirement**: This solution relies on **manual cookie injection**. You will need to exporting your cookies from `notebooklm.google.com` (using a browser extension like "Cookie-Editor" or "EditThisCookie" or Chrome DevTools) and save them to a file named `notebooklm_cookies.json` in the artifacts directory.
>
> 1. Log in to [notebooklm.google.com](https://notebooklm.google.com).
> 2. Export cookies as JSON.
> 3. Paste them into `notebooklm_cookies.json`.

## Proposed Changes

### [NEW] `notebooklm_client.py`
Create a Python script that uses `playwright` to:
1.  Launch a headless Chrome context.
2.  Inject cookies from `notebooklm_cookies.json`.
3.  Navigate to a specified Notebook URL.
4.  Wait for the implementation input box (`textarea.query-box-input`).
5.  Type the user's question.
6.  Wait for the response (`.to-user-container`).
7.  Print the response to stdout.

### [NEW] `notebooklm_cookies.json`
Create a template JSON file for the user to paste their cookies into.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **User Action**: User pastes valid cookies into `notebooklm_cookies.json`.
2.  **Run Command**:
    ```bash
    python3 notebooklm_client.py --url "https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/YOUR_NOTEBOOK_ID" --question "Summarize this notebook"
    ```
3.  **Success Criteria**: The script prints a summary generated by NotebookLM.
